# DVD Logos
Tons of bouncing DVD logos in many different forms and programming languages!

## Basic Rules
These are simple rules I made for myself while I made these programs. They're split into 3 levels.

### Mandatory
- Logo is an image from `images/`.
- Logo moves perfectly diagonally.

### Recommended
- Logo switches colors each bounce.
- Logo isn't warped.

### Optional
- Logo starts in center.
- Logo color can't switch to the color it already is.

## Current forms:
- `p5.js` ([p5 Javascript Library](https://editor.p5js.org/ehan.nayif/full/61O4kyaYw))
- `py.exe` (PyInstaller Windows Executable)
- `.html` (HTML, JavaScript, & CSS)
- `.json` ([CatWeb Webpage](https://www.roblox.com/games/16855862021/CatWeb-Make-a-Website))
- `.py` (Python)
- `.rb` (Ruby)
- `.rbxl` ([Roblox Place](https://www.roblox.com/games/74258950827465/DVD-Logo))
- `.sb3` ([Scratch Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1154557693/))
