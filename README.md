# DVD Logos
Tons of bouncing DVD logos in many different forms and programming languages!

## Basic Rules
These are simple rules I made for myself while I made these programs. They're split into 3 levels.

### Mandatory
- Logo is an image from `[images/](https://github.com/las-r/dvd-logo/tree/main/images)`.
- Logo moves perfectly diagonally.

### Recommended
- Logo switches colors each bounce.
- Logo isn't warped.

### Optional
- Logo starts in center.
- Logo color can't switch to the color it already is.
